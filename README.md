# 🧠 Onitama: Strategy Board Game in Code

Welcome to our implementation of **Onitama**, a fast-paced abstract strategy board game! This project was developed as part of our collaboration, where we applied key concepts like **object-oriented programming**, **data structures**, and **clean code principles** — showcasing our growth from previous individual projects. 🛠️

## 🎯 About the Game

Onitama is a 2-player strategy game played on a 5x5 board. Each player has 1 Master and 4 Students. Movement is determined by 5 randomly drawn movement cards, which rotate between players after each turn.

To win, a player must:
- 🥋 Capture the opponent’s Master
- 🏯 Move their own Master into the opponent’s Temple (center of their first row)

## 💡 Key Features

- ♟️ **Fully playable 2-player version**
- 🧱 **Object-Oriented Design**: 
  - `Board`, `Player`, `Piece`, and `Card` classes
- 🗃️ **Data Structures**:
  - 2D arrays for the board
  - Queues or Lists for card rotation
- 🎯 **Turn-based logic**
- 📜 **Terminal-based UI** (for now!)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- 💻 Language: Python
- 🧠 Concepts used:
  - Object-Oriented Programming
  - Data Structures (lists, tuples, enums)
  - Modular code design
  - Game loop logic
